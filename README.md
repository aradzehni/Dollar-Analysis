# GPR (Geopolitical and Economic Risk) Index â€“ Iran-Focused Analysis

This repository hosts the **visual output (`index.html`)** of a custom **Geopolitical and Economic Risk (GPR) Scoring System** developed to monitor, quantify, and visualize the impact of global and regional events on the **Islamic Republic of Iran**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

The GPR project is designed to analyze daily news and assign them a **numerical risk score** ranging from **-10 (high positive impact)** to **+10 (high negative impact)** based on their **geopolitical and economic relevance to Iran**.

Each news item is assessed using a structured 3-step framework:
1. **Relevance to Iran** â€“ Direct, indirect, or no involvement.
2. **Type of impact** â€“ Geopolitical or economic.
3. **Magnitude & direction** â€“ Scored on a calibrated -10 to +10 scale.

The result is a daily or weekly sentiment trend visualized in this HTML report.

## ðŸ“Š File Description

## ðŸ”’ Code Access
